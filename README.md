# InfiniteSudoku
InfiniteSudoku is a Unity based sudoku game that uses a sudoku generator algorithm I wrote to generate an unlimited number of sudoku puzzles of different difficulties based on players preference. I have implemented an undo button, erase button, edit mode, save state, and difficulty selection so far. Work in progress.

This is a game I made for my grandpa since he loves sudoku and always seems to run out of puzzles to do in his books. However, anyone who is interested in sudoku should enjoy it.
