# InfiniteSudoku
InfiniteSudoku is a Unity based sudoku game that uses a sudoku generator algorithm I wrote to generate an unlimited number of sudoku puzzles of different difficulties based on players preference. I have implemented an undo button, erase button, edit mode, save state, and difficulty selection so far. Work in progress.
